# Bank Customer Direct Marketing Campaign Analysis
Optimize a bank's direct marketing campaign through Python

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide data-driven insights to optimize a bank's direct marketing campaigns by understanding customer behavior and factors contributing to churn. Using the "Bank Customer Churn Prediction" dataset from Kaggle, the project develops predictive models to discern customer churn tendencies, enabling strategic, preemptive customer retention initiatives.

## Dataset
The dataset includes details like customer ID, credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, account balance, number of products, credit card status, activity status, estimated salary, and churn status. It serves as a crucial resource for predicting customer churn and shaping retention strategies.

## Technical Details
- **Data Collection and Preparation:** Data is collected from Kaggle, cleaned, and preprocessed for analysis. Tasks include handling missing values, splitting data into numerical and categorical types, and transforming data for better model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis is performed to understand data characteristics, distributions, and relationships between variables. This includes univariate and bivariate analyses to uncover insights into customer demographics and behavior patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Machine learning models are employed to predict customer churn. Techniques used include logistic regression and gradient boosting, optimized through ensemble methods for best performance.

## Key Findings
- Churn rates vary significantly by geography, with the highest in Germany.
- Older age groups tend to have higher churn rates.
- Gender-specific strategies may be effective as females showed a higher churn rate than males.

## Recommendations
- Implement targeted marketing strategies for high-risk demographic groups.
- Develop personalized retention programs for customers showing potential churn indicators.
- Utilize customer feedback to refine and adjust marketing and retention strategies continuously.
